=============================================
Localization of Commotion-specific components of Commotion-OpenWRT

Individual language packs are available as optional build settings in Commotion-Router (https://github.com/opentechinstitute/commotion-router).

The LuCI Translation Portal (http://i18n.luci.subsignal.org/pootle/) provides ongoing support for internationalization of menus and text strings in OpenWRT.

The Commotion-Router UI modifies and extends the default OpenWRT theme, and also adds custom components. This repository maintains Commotion supported language packages.  

Translation of Commotion OpenWRT is managed on Transifex:
